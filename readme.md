# Spring Reverb Microphone

A fully mechanical spring reverb microphone that turns your voice into analog echo without any DSP. Built from scratch using a 3D-printed body, spring-based delay path, and a piezo pickup system—this mic brings vintage "boing" energy to your recordings.

## What It Is

It’s not just a microphone. It’s a live acoustic effect chamber in your hand. You speak, and the diaphragm captures your voice. That vibration runs through a spring, adds character, and hits a second membrane where a piezo disc turns it into audio. No plugins. No software. Just physics.
