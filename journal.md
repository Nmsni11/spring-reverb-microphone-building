### Daily Logs

**Day 1 – 01/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Began by sketching the microphone body and the reverb path. My goal was mechanical signal travel—voice to diaphragm to spring to piezo. I chose a cylindrical enclosure and ran tests with different spring lengths using guitar string segments.

**Day 2 – 02/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 8 hours  
Modeled the internal housing and diaphragm in Fusion. I tested thin vs thick PLA walls for vibration damping. I 3D-printed a base shell and ran knock tests on membranes for resonance.

---

**Day 3 – 03/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Mounted the piezo disc onto the secondary diaphragm and added acoustic isolation using foam. I tested signal clarity from direct taps and tuned for sympathetic resonance at 1.2–1.6 kHz.

**Day 4 – 04/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Printed the upper cylinder and added an integrated strain relief groove for the shielded cable. Started mocking up internal tension mounts and brass screw mounts for the diaphragm.

**Day 5 – 05/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 7 hours  
I connected the piezo to the JRC4558 preamp module and ran signal tests into a DAW. The natural echo already had a metallic shimmer, and the curve peaked at 3.7 kHz. Soldered all internal leads with shielding.

**Day 6 – 06/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Tuned the spring using tension knobs. I ran vocal test samples and recorded impulse response data. Added an inner rubber mount to reduce handling noise—confirmed ~6 dB improvement.

---

**Day 7 – 07/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Mounted an XLR-compatible low-noise preamp and recorded comparisons between clean piezo out and boosted op-amp signal. Printed new lid design to hold the preamp internally.

---

**Day 8 – 08/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 8 hours  
Connected a 12AX7-based tube preamp inline to warm the sound. Compared tonal curves and found improved harmonic richness. Vent holes were added to reduce internal heat buildup.

---

**Day 9 – 09/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Assembled the full enclosure. I used machine screws to allow tension tweaks. Printed a grooved path for the spring so it doesn’t rub the wall. Connected the ¼″ jack with relief.

---

**Day 10 – 10/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Stress-tested the spring response to vocal plosives and high SPL. No distortion—just a satisfying "boing" tail. I analyzed waveforms and cleaned up preamp gain stages for balance.

---

**Day 11 – 11/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 7 hours  
Added a USB 24-bit sound card for PC capture. Setup latency tests, and the full chain from mic to PC ran under 12ms. I tested it with vocals, shakers, and guitar amp feedback.

---

**Day 12 – 12/06/2025**  
*Time Spent:* 6 hours  
Final touch-ups. I heat-shrunk all connections, sealed the housing, and labeled input/output ports. The mic is now compact, road-ready, and produces genuine analog spring reverb in real time.
